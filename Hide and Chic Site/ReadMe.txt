I designed the layout as I was building it, it's built using Bootstrap.
It was good practise as I ran into some problems when making sure the
page was responsive and maintained a visually appealing layout when viewed
on a smaller screen. Curse you overlapping imgs! Overall I'm happy
with how the page turned out, I might tweak it as my coding skills improve.
